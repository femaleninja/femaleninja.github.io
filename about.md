### More Information

My background is that I live in Tsuruoka, Japan. Although I never attended MIT, I have attended similar programs, loved them, and they are the reason for my interest in EECS and math. Besides computer programming, I play the piano and love making, playing, and writing music. In my free time, I like to play frisbee, climb, skate, paint, and pretend to parkour. I am also interested in mathematics (prime numbers), photography, critters, colors, plants, heavy rainstorms, anime and overworking. Feel free to email me if you guys are unbearably excited. :)
