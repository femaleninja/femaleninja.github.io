title: Describing an unknown SQLite database 
---

Recently we were given SQlite database and tasked with writing queries
to extract various insights. Problem was, we weren't given any
information about the database tables.

While talking with a fellow student about how to figure out what was
inside the database, I realized this function I wrote that
reconstructs the layout of an unknown SQLite table might be useful.

```python
def describe_table(cursor, table_name):
    """
    Returns description of SQLite table as CREATE TABLE statement.
    """
    cursor.execute('PRAGMA table_info("{}");'.format(table_name))
    table_info = cursor.fetchall()

    indent = ' '*4
    primary_keys = []
    name_width = 2 + max([len(col_info[1]) for col_info in table_info])
    fmt = '{:' + str(name_width) + 's}{:10s}{} DEFAULT {}\n'

    desc = 'CREATE TABLE "{}" (\n'.format(table_name)
    for col_info in table_info:
        _, name, type_, allow_null, default, primary = col_info
        desc += indent + fmt.format(
            name, type_, '' if allow_null else ' NOT NULL', default
        )
        if primary:
            primary_keys.append(name)

    if primary_keys:
        desc += indent + 'PRIMARY KEY ({})\n'.format(', '.join(primary_keys))
    desc += ');\n'
    return desc
```

You pass the function a ```sqlite3``` cursor and table name, and it
returns a ```CREATE TABLE``` string describing the table. 

SQLite stores the table names in its ```sqlite_master``` table.  This
snippet describes all the table in a file:

```python
cnx.execute('SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type="table"')
for name in cnx.fetchall()[1:]:
    print(describe_table(cnx, name[0]))
```

Where ```cnx``` is the sqlite3 cursor. E.g.,

```python
import sqlite3
cnx = sqlite3.connect('database.sqlite').cursor()
```
