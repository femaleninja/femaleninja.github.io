I thought it best to keep this blog related to all things related to the principles of good design, writing clean code and data science but felt the need to diverge from the prime focus of this to talk about my recent association with the Wisconsin Icecube Particle Physics Collaboration. It all started when one of their postdocs, Donglian, spontaneously hit me up on Facebook with a video call request unannounced. I'm happy to announce that I'll now be working (in limited capacity) with the collaboration after receiving a message from Donglian a few weeks ago and linking with her colleague Tianlu Yuan et al. [and a few others currently stationed at the south pole]~
